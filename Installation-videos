Java Code execution process -

How does Java work?
“Write once run anywhere”
Java JDK - Converts plain text files (.java) to Java bytecode files (.class)
Java JVM - Takes java bytecode files (.class) and converts them to machine code 
for the machine you are currently on.

If the program is large containing multiple files, then java will first convert
all the seperate files in respective .class file and then JVM will link those .class files
together to get one big executable file. This process of linking files is called linking.


Java is little bit of both - compiled and interpreted - https://www.baeldung.com/java-compiled-interpreted


In c, the #include command is what tells C compiler to link the particular library to the program.


Good questions - 

    What’s the difference between compiling, linking, and execution?
    What’s the difference between a compiled and interpreted language?
    Is Python compiled or interpreted?
    Is C compiled or interpreted?
    What are the pros and cons of an interpreted language versus a compiled language?
    What is the function of the Java JDK?
    What is the function of the Java JVM?
    Between JDK and JVM which is machine specific?
    What is Java’s tag line and what does it mean?


Name an example of the kind of benefits that might be provided by linked code in C.
Does a compiled C program run on every computer operating system or 
just the operating system associated with the compilation of the C program?
