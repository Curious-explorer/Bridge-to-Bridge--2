Java Code execution process -

How does Java work?
“Write once run anywhere”
Java JDK - Converts plain text files (.java) to Java bytecode files (.class)
Java JVM - Takes java bytecode files (.class) and converts them to machine code 
for the machine you are currently on.

If the program is large containing multiple files, then java will first convert
all the seperate files in respective .class file and then JVM will link those .class files
together to get one big executable file. This process of linking files is called linking.


Java is little bit of both - compiled and interpreted - https://www.baeldung.com/java-compiled-interpreted


In c, the #include command is what tells C compiler to link the particular library to the program.
