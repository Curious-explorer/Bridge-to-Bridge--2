Q. Why python is slower than java or c?
- Python is dynamically typed language, meaning variables can change their types in a code.
- Because of this python interpreter takes time to understand the code by doing multiple checks on the variables.
- This causes program to take much time that needed.
- On the otehr hand, java and c are statically typed meaning, type of a variable is stated at the start.
- This makes their respective compilers easy to understand the code and it has to perform less checks.
- And that's why we see difference in performance.

Q. LISP has a funky addition operation - (+ 1 2). We would normally see that as 1 + 2. 
Why do you think that LISP is designed to order that operation that way?
- I think this is because normally, if we have to add multiple integers we have to write, 1+2+3.
- I think since LISP is a Functional laguage, the + sign here represents Summation operation, meaning,
- to add many integers we just have to write it as + 1 2 3 34 56, and language will add them.

Q. Letâ€™s say that we ask you to learn a brand new language, created by the Roux faculty, the RouxCrew Language. 
What are some (programming) things you might look for to get started working with that language?
- How to do basic print statements?
- How to declear variables?
- How loop works in this language?
