### 1.  Programming Laguages Families - 
-  There are many programming Languages available today. They are useful to understand the fact that, eventhough the language might be different there are many concepts can be carried over from one language to another.
-  That is why learning one language with deep understanding will help you adapt to any new language with ease.
-  Families are the way to classify languages based on their functionality and behavior.
-  Two of the most dominant families are - Procedural , and functional programming language families.
-  **Procedural languages** - C, java, python 
-  These languages do processes one after other and get the task done.
-  **Functional languages** - Haskell, Scheme
-  These languages are specifically made for working with Mathematical fuctions.
