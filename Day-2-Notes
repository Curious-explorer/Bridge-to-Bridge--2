Day2 - Notes -

Debugging -
1. Use print statements a lot to debug a problem
2. Isolate the problems, and then deal with them, unlike python here try to divide the problems as much as you can.
3. Usally Java and C uses CamelCase.
4. Debuggers in IDE help a ton but, try to identify the error before using them.

Types and typing in Java and C -
1. Static vs dynamic typing
Dynamic Typing - the “type” of a variable is determined when the application is run
Static Typing - the “type” of a variable is determined at compile time
2. Basic data types like int, double, char are same in java and C.
3. It is usually recommended to initialize the variable with 0 at the time of declearation
in the program, just to keep things simeple.
4. We can convert values from one data type to other in either implicit or explicit
fashon, but some of the data will be lost if later data type has smaller range than initial one.
i.e. 3.9 (float) if we convert to integer than only 3 will be saved, partial data is lost.
